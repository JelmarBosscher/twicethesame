        			<p><strong>'As soon as Twice The Same's show kicks off, it's shit hot.'</strong> These four ambitious lads burst out on to the stage faster and louder than a pyrotechnic explosion! Prepare yourself for an eccentric blast of steady hard rock combined with finger lickin' funk. This Holland based rock band has built up a reputation of playing solid, unique, energetic and in-your-face shows. </p>
                                          <p> Twice The Same is currently working on their debut album. After EP's such as 'Raw Meat' and 'Dirty Needles' it's time for an actual full length record - the kind your mother would try to ban if you were a kid in the 80s.

					<p>Is it filthy, deep bass licks you're looking for?.. Then <strong>mr. Mart Schijf</strong> is gonna be your new favourite distant son-in-law you never had. This guy doesn't only provide the rock solid lower frequency noise, he also gives the tracks a funky slapping edge. You'll start drooling and stop blinking when you see this dude live. He will leave you asking yourself why you've never paid this much attention to the bass before..</p>

					<p>If you give this guy a guitar and a pick, a humongous eargasm is unavoidable. <strong>Pez'</strong> mind-blowing ability to combine different styles to create his own unique sound is ineffable. The unimaginable amount of love, hard work, passion and creativity <strong>Pez</strong> adds to TTS makes him the guitarist that will rock your socks off, over and over again!</p>
